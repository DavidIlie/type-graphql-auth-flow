# type-graphql authentication flow

The point of this project was to learn about GraphQL to use it with future projects.

This is a graphql api which has an entire authentication system (registering, verifying email, logging in, logging out, oauth and so on). Furthermore, JWT is used for token management and the database of choice is MongoDB, however it can be easily adapted to other database solutions such as Postgresql by modifying the `ormconfig.json`.

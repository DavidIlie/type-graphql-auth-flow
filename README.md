# type-graphql authentication flow

Basic GraphQL api with an entire authentication flow built in:

-   Registering & Email Confirmation
-   Logging in / Logging out
-   oauth2 with GitHub (soon)

This is my first ever project with GraphQL, I decided to create an authentication flow so that I can re-use this code in the future when I create full APIs using GraphQL
